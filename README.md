# Bayesian_State-Space_Modelling_of_Serengeti_Wildebeest

We analysed data collected on observations of wildebeest in the Serengeti over a thirty-year period and used Monte Carlo Markov Chain simulation to develop a Discrete Time model with density-independent growth describing wildebeest population dynamics. Using this model we could make estimates of future wildebeest harvest projected five years beyond the period which the data describe. The Kenyan and Tanzanian Serengeti ecosystem is one of the largest migratory ungulate populations in the world and the study and management of these populations is intrinsic to understanding and managing the wider ecosystem, which is of national and international importance.
