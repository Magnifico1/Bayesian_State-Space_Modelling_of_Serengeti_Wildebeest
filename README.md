# Bayesian_State-Space_Modelling_of_Serengeti_Wildebeest

We analysed data collected on observations of wildebeest in the Serengeti over a thirty-year period to develop a Disrete Timel with density-independent growth from which we could make estimates of future wildebeest harvest.
Kenyan and Tanzanian Serengeti ecosystem, one of the largest migratory ungulate 
populations in the world. The study and management of these 
populations is intrinsic to understanding and 
managing the wider ecosystem, which is of national 
and international importance. 

MCMCdevelop a Bayesian State-Space model for the wildebeest population dynamics using the wildebeest data to estimate parameters of the population dynamics model, including the relationship between growth rate and rainfall, and project the population forward 5 years into the future (i.e., from 1990 to 1994).
